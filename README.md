# !tired

!tired is a fictional coffee brand aimed at developers that I created to make this landing page.  
This was just a challenge that I made for myself, I created a prototype and transformed it into code.   

You can check the demo [here](https://takasteel.github.io/coffee-landing-page/).  
(The anchor links don't work, this is just a single page project)
